<h2>Assignment 4 - Meta Learning and Continous learning</h2>


<h4> 1) Implement a colab for  reptile MAML algorithm in keras/tensorflow  for meta learning on a small dataset from scratch </h4>

I have applied Reptile Algorithm on Omniglot dataset. The colab is descriptive and detailed with the processes of data preparation, visualization of data, defining hyperparameters, building the model using reptile algorithm, and visualizing results <br>

<h4> 2) Implement a colab for meta learning using prototypical networks in pytorch </h4>

I have applied prototypical networks on CIFAR100 dataset. The colab is descriptive and detailed with the processes of data preparation, visualization of data, defining hyperparameters, building the model using reptile algorithm, and visualizing results <br>
